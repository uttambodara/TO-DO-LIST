# TO-DO-LIST
What is TO-DO-LIST ?

A to-do list is just a list of things you have to-do. That means basically anything and everything can be on your to-do list—but just because you've written your to-dos down doesn't mean your to-do list is actually useful. Effectively tracking when your work is due can help you prioritize and get great work done


What is an example of a to-do list?

List all of the tasks that you need to accomplish. These can range from “Shower” to “Finish presentation for work next week” to “Find a present for Mom's birthday next month.” As you can see, these tasks range in their nature, their importance, and the time they will take.
